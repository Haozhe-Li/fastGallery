- **Batch Pictures Upload:** Copy and paste all your pictures you wish to uplaod to `/tests/image_folder`, and run the python script `python3 update_picdb_from_folder.py` under `/tests` directory. All the pictures will be loaded into database with filename as title, and empty description.\
- **Smart Tagging and Search:** This feature is enabled by default. You can disable this feature by unchecking the checkbox in the configuration page by running ``python3 config_handler.py``.
